# SoAS Model

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) rapidly transform individual systems by providing autonomous capabilities. This new class of systems becomes a constituent system in a System of Systems (SoS), evolving it into a System of Autonomous Systems (SoAS). SoAS is fraught with new Systems Engineering (SE) challenges for architecting, integration, testing, and evaluation that originate from the Level of Autonomy (LoA) of autonomous systems. LoA refers to the level of autonomous capabilities of a system depending on its AI/ML technology. To address the challenges imposed by LoA, we proposed a comprehensive SE methodology for architecting and evaluating SoAS. This methodology is divided into two parts. 

The first part focuses on applying systems engineering concepts and principles to create architecture for SoAS. This falls under the System Engineering for AI (SE4AI) umbrella where SE principles are tailored to accommodate challenges posed by the integration of autonomy. The model provided here (i.e., SoAS_Archtecture.mdzip) demonstrates our proposed Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) method for SoAS architecture and integration implemented on a hypothetical search-and-rescue example. This method builds upon the Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM) and modifies it to facilitate autonomy integration by leveraging the SWOT (i.e., Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat) analysis and SoAS taxonomy. Moreover, the proposed method tailors the Unified Architecture Framework (UAF) to model different levels of abstraction of SoAS with varying LoAs. The current model guides the identification and creation of multiple SoAS architectures in the UAF that must be analyzed for suitability and emergent behavior to select an architecture with the most suitable LoAs. This model was developed in Magic Systems of Systems Architect.

The second part then focuses on the test and evaluation of feasible SoAS architectures by applying the emerging AI/ML techniques to examine test and evaluation challenges imposed by LoA such as identifying the suitable LoA in constituent systems of SoAS and undesired emergent behaviors. We proposed a test and evaluation method that provides stakeholders with a decision analysis tool to make data-driven informed decisions about the most suitable SoAS architecture while considering uncertainty and emergent behaviors. The proposed method enables SoAS analysis by introducing AI techniques for Systems Engineering (AI4SE) by integrating the Bayesian Network (BN) and ML algorithms for executable Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) architectures. The model provided here (i.e., SoAS_Analysis.R) demonstrates the steps to achieve the data required for the SoAS Bayesian Network. This model was developed in RStudio software tool. The Bayesian Network shared here (i.e., BN_Model.xdsl) provides two types of analyses: predictive analysis to select the most suitable LoAs in constituent systems that yield the desirable SoAS performance; and prescriptive analysis to identify the root causes of an observed SoAS undesired emergent behavior and define preventive strategies for future operations. This model was developed in GeNIe Academic software tool and can be accessed in the Releases section of this repository.
