# A Systems Engineering Methodology for System of Autonomous Systems

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) rapidly transform individual systems by providing autonomous capabilities. This new class of systems becomes a constituent system in a System of Systems (SoS), evolving it into a System of Autonomous Systems (SoAS). SoAS is fraught with new Systems Engineering (SE) challenges for architecting, integration, testing, and evaluation that originate from the Level of Autonomy (LoA) of autonomous systems. LoA refers to the level of autonomous capabilities of a system depending on its AI/ML technology. Architecting challenges include addressing interface compatibility, safety, and security considerations. Evaluation challenges are concerned with identifying the suitable LoA in constituent systems and undesired emergent behaviors. 
We proposed a comprehensive SE methodology to address these LoA-imposed challenges. This methodology consists of two parts. 

The first part focuses on applying SE concepts and principles to create architecture for SoAS. This falls under the System Engineering for AI (SE4AI) umbrella where SE principles are tailored to accommodate challenges posed by the integration of autonomy. In this part, we proposed a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) method that builds upon the Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM) and modifies it to facilitate autonomy integration by leveraging the SWOT (i.e., Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat) analysis and SoAS taxonomy. Moreover, the proposed method tailors the Unified Architecture Framework (UAF) to model different levels of abstraction of SoAS with varying LoAs. The proposed method provides a step-by-step guide to perform the autonomy integration including how to identify LoA impacts, how to model varying LoAs in the SoAS architecture, and what UAF views to build. The model provided here (i.e., SoAS_Archtecture.mdzip) demonstrates the implementation of our proposed method on a hypothetical search-and-rescue example. The current model leads to creating multiple executable SoAS architectures, each corresponding to a particular LoA, that are simulated to generate the necessary evaluation data for a trade study analysis. This model was developed in Magic Systems of Systems Architect.

The second part then focuses on the test and evaluation of the feasible SoAS architectures developed in the first part. We proposed a test and evaluation method that provides stakeholders with a decision analysis tool to make data-driven decisions about the most suitable SoAS architecture while considering uncertainty and emergent behaviors. The proposed method enables SoAS analysis by introducing AI techniques for Systems Engineering (AI4SE) by integrating the Bayesian Network (BN) and ML algorithms with executable MBSE architectures. The model provided here (i.e., SoAS_Analysis.R) demonstrates the steps to achieve the data (i.e., BN_Data.csv) required for the SoAS's BN. This model was developed in RStudio software tool. Then, the data are used to create the BN model (i.e., BN_Model.xdsl), provided in the Releases section of this repository. This model was developed in GeNIe Academic software tool. The final BN provides two types of analyses: predictive analysis to select the most suitable LoAs in constituent systems that yield the desired SoAS performance; and prescriptive analysis to identify the root causes of an observed SoAS undesired emergent behavior and define preventive strategies for future operations.
